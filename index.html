                In the wake of recent customer data breaches, companies are recognizing the need for more protections
                and transparency around the collection and use of customer data. But few have paid equal attention to
                the issues arising from the collection and mining of workplace data, If you want to know

                Companies have vast amounts of valuable data on work and their workforce, and executives recognize the
                opportunity to use this data to improve productivity and to motivate and engage people. But employees
                are skeptical.

                of the employees are willing to let their employers collect and use data on them and their work, but
                only if they benefit in some way. And they harbor serious concerns about how companies might use the
                data. Perhaps for good reason: only

                data responsibly.

                Give Employees More Control Consumers have become highly conscious of how their personal data is used
                and misused. And they have
                been supported by new laws and regulations that give them more control over their data. But this isnâ€™t
                the case in the workplace.
