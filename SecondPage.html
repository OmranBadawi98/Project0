       <h2><span>The Importance of Business Goals</span></h2>
       <h4 class="h4">Businesses should not fear setting goals because there is absolutely no downside to the process. Goals give a business direction and help measure results. There are four detailed and important reasons why a business should have goals.</h4>
       <div>
       <ol class="screen-only">
       	<li><span>Measure success - </span>Good organizations should always be trying to improve, grow, and become more efficient. Setting goals provides the clearest way to measure the success of the company.</li>
       	<li><span>Leadership cohesion -</span>Setting goals ensures that everyone understands what the organization is trying to achieve. When the leadership team clearly understands what the business is trying to accomplish, it provides greater rationale for the decisions management might make regarding hiring, acquisitions, incentives, sales programs, etc.</li>
       	<li><span>Knowledge is power - </span>If an employee knows and understands the goals, it becomes easier for him or her to make daily decisions based on the long- and short-term goals that were established.</li>
       	<li><span> Reassess goals -</span>When goals are set, they can be monitored on a regular basis to verify the business is headed in the right direction. If the business is not achieving or moving towards accomplishing its goals, then changes or adjustments need to be made.</li>
       </ol>
   </div>
       <h2><span>Pitfalls of Developing Business Goals</span></h2>
       <h4 class="h4">Setting business goals can go wrong if not done correctly. Seasoned business managers put a great deal of time and energy into developing and implementing business goals. There are two big pitfalls a business manager should try to avoid.</h4>
       <div>
       <ul>
       	<li><span>Setting unrealistically high goals -</span>When a goal is perceived to be unreachable, no effort will be made by the employees to achieve them. A businessperson needs to set realistic goals so that the employees can come together as a team to achieve them.</li>
       	<li><span>Setting vague and ambiguous goals -</span>Goals that are not specific enough do not lead to action and are useless. If achievements cannot be measured against the businesses expectations, then a manager cannot observe any progress towards the goal.

       </ul>
